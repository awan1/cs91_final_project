\section{Project Proposal}

\subsection{Problem}
\textbf{A description of the problem you plan to solve and the motivations for doing so (i.e., why this problem is interesting/important).}

Twitter is a social media platform with 284 million users active per month, tweeting approximately 500 million tweets
per day.~\cite{twitter} At a maximum of 140 characters per tweet and about 1 byte per character\footnote{Issues arise with different
encodings, but we ignore these for the sake of our back-of-the-envelope calculation} this represents an informational
flow of over 70GB of text per day. An average book is about 2MB in size~\cite{bookfact}, so Twitter users are collectively
writing about 35,000 books a day.

With this wealth of textual information that is often supplemented with geo-location data and content-connecting hashtags,
